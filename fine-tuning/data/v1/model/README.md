  - 'Title: Sperry Top-Sider Leeward 2 Eye Boat Shoe | Brand: 6pm Sperry Top-Sider
    Footwear RP | Description: Leeward 2-Eye Corduroy Boat Shoe Best known for boat
    shoes that have logged more miles of open ocean than any other brand, the Sperry
    Top-Sider story began on a raw winter day in New England. When avid sailor and
    hobbyist inventor Paul Sperry let his dog Prince out for his daily exercise, he
    noticed that the cocker spaniel was remarkably stable, even at a full run on the
    snow covered, icy crust. Paul raced back to his laboratory to begin working. Using
    pieces of rubber, a razor blade, and an ordinary sneaker, Paul had soon pieced
    together the prototype of the world''s first boat shoe. Subsequent designs yielded
    the original Sperry Top-Sider now known as the Authentic Original. Since 1935,
    Sperry Top-Sider has been the leading brand of footwear for those who love the
    water. From its introduction of the world''s first siped rubber outsole for non-marking
    traction, to its advanced technical fabrication to combat the elements, Sperry
    Top-Sider remains the vanguard of high-performance amphibious footwear. Available
    around the globe in fine independent, marine, and department stores, Sperry Top-Sider
    is the official footwear of the U.S. Sailing Team, Zodiac Academy, the World Billfish
    Series, and the Shimano Fishing Tour. | Categories: Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry,

  - 'Title: Stahlwille 96410704 Double Ended Ring Wrench Set Corona, 6mm x 7mm to
    20mm x 22mm, Shallow Offset, Chrome Alloy Steel, Chrome Plated, No.23/8, 8 pcs
    | Brand: Stahlwille | Description: Stahwhile 96410704 Double-ended Ring Wrench
    Set CORONA with Shallow Offset Heads are made of chrome alloy steel, drop forged,
    hardened and tempered to provide high torque and added leverage, and polished
    with chrome finish for protection against rust and corrosion and offers high hardness.
    This professional wrench set has thin-walled rings and 10-degree shallow ring
    end offset which facilitate work in confined or tight spaces, perfect hand tool
    for automotive repair and maintenance, machinery, etc. In addition, the rings
    are higher than standard nuts - which prevents the spanner seizing on the nut.
    It also has Anti-Slip Drive (AS Drive) profile which enables high force transmission
    without damaging the fasteners. While the force acts on the flats of the screws,
    the corners are left free and are not rounded off. This wrench set is packed in
    a carton. It includes 6mm x 7mm, 8mm x 9mm, 10mm x 11mm, 12mm x 13mm, 14mm x 15mm,
    16mm x 17mm, 18mm x 19mm, and 20mm x 22mm double ended ring wrenches. Made of
    course in Germany and manufactured under the most stringent quality control conditions
    and adheres to DIN 897/ISO 10104 specifications. There are many wrenches available.
    But hardly any that are as well thought out as Stahlwille wrenches. The non-slip
    finish means all our wrenches fit comfortably in the hand, even when used for
    long periods of time and when higher forces are applied. By combining high-quality
    special steels, which are subject to continuous quality controls, with a sophisticated
    forging process, we make them particularly durable and robust. The thumb groove
    along the wrench handle eliminates material where there is no stress and concentrates
    it where it is needed. Similar to the principle of an H-beam in construction,
    extreme load bearing capacity and maximum flexural strength are achieved with
    lower weight. As one of only a few manufacturers, Stahlwille offers a comprehensively
    diverse range of metric, imperial, spline drive and TORX wrenches. Stahlwille''s
    tight manufacturing tolerances and reproducible dimensional accuracy ensure that
    one Stahlwille wrench is as close-fitting as the next. In this way, both open-jaw
    and ring wrenches will always firmly hug the fastener head for excellent power-lock.

# SentenceTransformer based on sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2

This is a [sentence-transformers](https://www.SBERT.net) model finetuned from [sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2). It maps sentences & paragraphs to a 384-dimensional dense vector space and can be used for semantic textual similarity, semantic search, paraphrase mining, text classification, clustering, and more.

## Model Details

### Model Description
- **Model Type:** Sentence Transformer
- **Base model:** [sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2) <!-- at revision c9745ed1d9f207416be6d2e6f8de32d1f16199bf -->
- **Maximum Sequence Length:** 256 tokens
- **Output Dimensionality:** 384 dimensions
- **Similarity Function:** Cosine Similarity
<!-- - **Training Dataset:** Unknown -->
<!-- - **Language:** Unknown -->
<!-- - **License:** Unknown -->

### Model Sources

- **Documentation:** [Sentence Transformers Documentation](https://sbert.net)
- **Repository:** [Sentence Transformers on GitHub](https://github.com/huggingface/sentence-transformers)
- **Hugging Face:** [Sentence Transformers on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/models?library=sentence-transformers)

### Full Model Architecture

```
SentenceTransformer(
  (0): Transformer({'max_seq_length': 256, 'do_lower_case': False, 'architecture': 'BertModel'})
  (1): Pooling({'word_embedding_dimension': 384, 'pooling_mode_cls_token': False, 'pooling_mode_mean_tokens': True, 'pooling_mode_max_tokens': False, 'pooling_mode_mean_sqrt_len_tokens': False, 'pooling_mode_weightedmean_tokens': False, 'pooling_mode_lasttoken': False, 'include_prompt': True})
  (2): Normalize()
)
```

## Usage

### Direct Usage (Sentence Transformers)

First install the Sentence Transformers library:

```bash
pip install -U sentence-transformers
```

Then you can load this model and run inference.
```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

# Download from the 🤗 Hub
model = SentenceTransformer("sentence_transformers_model_id")
# Run inference
